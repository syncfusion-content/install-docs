## Why is the Unlock Key displayed as Invalid while installing the setup?

Unlock Key can be validated as invalid for two reasons. They are:

* When you install a particular version’s setup with another version’s unlock key. Ensure that you enter the unlock key for that respective version.
* Some part of the unlock key code could have been altered or removed while copying the unlock key. Ensure that you copy the entire key without any spacing. 

  #### Earlier version of 11.1.*.*
