### Syncfusion Assemblies

The Syncfusion assemblies are installed in the following two locations: 

* Assemblies folder
* Global Assembly Cache (GAC)

**The Assemblies folder**

In the Assemblies folder, the assemblies are available in the following installation location:

 **Location:** {ProgramFilesFolder}\Syncfusion\Essential Studio\{Platform}\x.x.x.x\Assemblies

 N> * The sub-folder 3.5 is used with .NET 3.5 and the sub-folder 2.0 is used with .NET 2.0. In most cases, [System Drive]:\ is C:\.
 * In 2.0 and 3.5 GAC, the assemblies are available in {System Drive:}\WINDOWS\assembly. 
 * In 4.0, 4.5, 4.5.1 and 4.6 GAC, the assemblies are available in {System Drive:}\WINDOWS\ Microsoft.NET\assembly\GAC_MSIL.


Essential Studio ships the pre-built 2.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5.1 and 4.6 .NET Framework versions of the Syncfusion assemblies. These assemblies are located in the PreCompiledAssemblies location.        

**Location**: {ProgramFilesFolder}\Syncfusion\Essential Studio\{Platform}\x.x.x.x\PreCompiledAssemblies\x.x.x.x\{Framework}

When you work with multiple target environments, you can see that each appropriate version is installed in the GAC, for side-by-side usage.

Working with Syncfusion assemblies that have been built and tested with specific .NET Framework versions, greatly increases the overall reliability. It also allows Syncfusion controls to take advantage of features that may be available in specific environments. For instance .NET 2.0 variants of the control offer features specific to the .NET 2.0 environment.
