### Link Install Setup

Syncfusion provides the Link Install Setup to configure the Syncfusion controls in a build machine, in which Syncfusion Essential Studio is not installed. This installs Essential Studio assemblies into the target folder. It also registers the product key to enable you to compile a project developed on a build machine.
