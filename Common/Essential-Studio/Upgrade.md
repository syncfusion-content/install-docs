# Upgrade from one version to another version.

You can upgrade to the latest version by downloading and installing the platforms you require from [this](https://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/latest-version) link. After upgrading to the latest version, instead of upgrading your projects manually, you can use the Syncfusion Project Migration for migrating your projects.

# Upgrade from beta version to major version

Syncfusion started providing beta release before a new major Volume release from 2018 volume 3. You can download and install the beta release installer here.

You can uninstall the beta release setup before installing the major Volume release. As Syncfusion installer works independently, you can directly install the latest major Volume release which contains all the new features.

# Upgrade from major version to service pack version

Syncfusion provides a new Volume release once in every three months which has exciting new features. For that Volume release , there may be one or two Service Pack releases. The issues in the Volume release will be addressed in the Service Pack releases. You can download and install the latest Service Pack installer [here](https://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/latest-version). 


It is not required to install the Volume release before installing the Service Pack release. As Volume and Service Packs releases works independently, you can directly install the latest Service Pack which contains major issue fixes.
