### Installing a Patch Setup

The following procedure illustrates how to install a patch.


_Note:_

> * _Before installing the patch, ensure that corresponding Essential Studio version and platforms to install the patch in your machine._
> * _If you installed Syncfusion WinRT platform alone then the Assembly Manager execution dialog will not appear during the patch installation. It will skip this dialog from step 1 to step 4. Because, Assembly Manager Utility is not shipped with WinRT platform._



1. Double-click the Syncfusion Essential Studio patch setup file. The Syncfusion Essential Studio Service Pack opens.
