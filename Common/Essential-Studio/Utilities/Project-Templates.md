### Project Templates

Syncfusion provides Project Templates for the ASP.NET MVC platform to automatically refer the necessary reference and resource files in an application. However, this is not applicable to other platforms. In the other platforms, such as Windows Forms, WPF, Silverlight, and ASP.NET, the Syncfusion controls are automatically configured in the Microsoft Visual Studio Toolbox after the setup has been installed, and the controls can be used in the application by simply dragging them from the toolbox.
