   You can change the default option by clicking the other button. The version of the .NET Framework that the assemblies should be built with is specified here and is used automatically to rebuild the assemblies. 

**2. Product**

   The Product group box has a drop-down list box. By default, All is selected. You can change the default option by selecting one of the products from the drop-down list box.

This frame has eight options. All is selected by default. You can click the required product's button to perform the build operation.

   N> For assemblies that are not built and pre-compiled, assemblies that shipped with the product is automatically used.
