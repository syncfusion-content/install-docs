# Is it possible to cancel or revoke a license key?

Once a license key is generated from your Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> account, Syncfusion has no control over that key. This is because license validation is performed entirely offline and does not require an internet connection. Therefore, Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> cannot cancel, disable, or reset a license key once it has been generated.

License keys remain valid as long as they are used with the corresponding Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> product and version.

License keys can be generated from the **License & Downloads** section of your Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> account. Log in to your company account to generate the license key.

To learn more, refer to the following documentation: 
 
**[How to generate license key](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/how-to-generate)**

## Important Notes

- Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> license keys are **version- and product-specific** and include a timestamp.
- Each time you generate a key, a **new unique key** is created.
- Previously generated license keys are **not invalidated** when a new one is created.
- Syncfusion License keys are valid **for a lifetime** for the selected version and product.
- Only **trial license keys** expire after **30 days**.
