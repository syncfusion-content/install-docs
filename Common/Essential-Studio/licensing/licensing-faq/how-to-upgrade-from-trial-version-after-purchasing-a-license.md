# How to upgrade from Trial version after purchasing a license?

To upgrade from trial version, there are two possible solutions.

* Uninstall the trial version and install the fully licensed build from the [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads) section of our website.  
* Replace the currently used trial license key with a paid license key that can be generated from the [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads) section of our website.
