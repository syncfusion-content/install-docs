# How to upgrade from Trial version after purchasing a license?

There are two possible solutions

1. The first option is to uninstall the trial version and install the fully licensed build from the License & Downloads section of our website.  
2. You can replace the trial license key that you are currently using with a paid license key that can be generated from the License & Downloads section of our website.
