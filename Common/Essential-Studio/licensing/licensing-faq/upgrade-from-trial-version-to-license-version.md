# Upgrade from trial version to license version


You can upgrade your trial product to a licensed product using one of the following methods:

**If you are a licensed user:**

* Download your licensed version installer and install it on your machine. You can get your licensed version installer from [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads).
* Apply your license key in your project. You can get the license key from [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads). Refer to this [help topic](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/license-key) for more details about getting a license key.

**If you do not have any license:**

* Purchase a licensed product through the online [purchase page](https://www.syncfusion.com/sales/products).
* Contact our sales team to purchase the license in offline payment mode.

If you already have licensed products associated with your registered Syncfusion account, you can find your associated licenses from [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads). If you cannot find any license associated with your account, one of the following could be the reason:

* You did not purchase any Syncfusion products before.
* You are not the license holder of your license, and it may be associated with someone elseâ€™s email address. 
* You might have licenses associated with a different email address. 
* Your license administrator may not have assigned any licenses to your account. Contact your license admin.
