# Requirement to use Syncfusion with GitHub

While using Syncfusion components and wish to push the source code to a public repository or any open-source repositories, or share the source project with clients, **you should not publicly push or provide the Syncfusion license keys along with the sources.** The source code should be pushed or provided without the Syncfusion license keys.

You are allowed to distribute the deployed applications, but you should not distribute our license keys in a public environment or through the source code.
