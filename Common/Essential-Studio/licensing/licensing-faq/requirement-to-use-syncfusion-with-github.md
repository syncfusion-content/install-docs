# Requirement to use Syncfusion with Github

If you are trying to use our components and would like to push your source to a public repository\or any open-source repositories or sharing you source project to clients, **you should not push\provide your Syncfusion license keys publicly along with your sources.** You should push\provide your source without Syncfusion license keys.

You can inform the users to sign-up to us (Syncfusion) and get a trial or valid license to use our products.

You can distribute your deployed applications, but you shouldnâ€™t distribute our license keys in a public environment or through your sources.
