### Problem

If you install Licensed and Trial installer in the same machine, licensing issues will occur while development and the following licensing alert will be shown.

### Reason

Assemblies will conflict as both Licensed and Trial assemblies will be present in GAC.

### Suggested solution

To avoid licensing issues while running demos or using Syncfusion controls, launch the [Assembly Manager](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/utilities#assembly-manager) for the licensed product you're using for development and install the licensed assemblies in GAC.
