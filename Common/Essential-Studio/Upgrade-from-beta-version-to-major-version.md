# Upgrade from beta version to major version

Syncfusion started providing beta release before a new major Volume release from 2018 volume 3. You can download and install the beta release installer here.

You can uninstall the beta release setup before installing the major Volume release. As Syncfusion installer works independently, you can directly install the latest major Volume release which contains all the new features.
