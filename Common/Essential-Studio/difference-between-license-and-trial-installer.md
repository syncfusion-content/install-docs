# Difference between license installer and trial installer

Starting with v16.2.0.41 (2018 Vol 2), Syncfusion provides two separate installers.

   -	Trial Installer
   -	Licensed Installer

## Trial Installer

This trial installer is for evaluation purpose, and the components you use from this installer will expire in 30 days from the day of starting the evaluation. 

## Licensed Installer

If you are a paid customer, then from your accountâ€™s [download](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads) section, you can download and use the licensed version of our components. You can use our licensed components as long as you have a paid license.
