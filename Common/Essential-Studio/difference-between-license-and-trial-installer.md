# Difference between license installer and trial installer

Syncfusion provided following two type of installers till v19.4.0.48.

   -	Trial Installer
   -	Licensed Installer

### Trial Installer

This trial installer is for evaluation purpose, and the components you use from this installer will expire in 30 days from the day of starting the evaluation. 

### Licensed Installer

If you are a paid customer, then from your accountâ€™s [download](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads) section, you can download and use the licensed version of our components. You can use our licensed components as long as you have a paid license.

N> Starting with 2022 Volume 1 v20.1.0.47, all Syncfusion customers (evaluators and paid customers) who use Syncfusion installers or nuget packages from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Syncfusion) must generate and register the corresponding platform and version license key in your projects.<br>
