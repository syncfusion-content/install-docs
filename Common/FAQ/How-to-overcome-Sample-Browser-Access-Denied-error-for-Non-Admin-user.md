# How to overcome Sample Browser Access Denied error for Non-Admin User?

When an Administrator installs Essential Studio in a machine, a non-admin user cannot run the Sample Browser from the Dashboard, as this action tries to access the Admin folder where the samples are installed. The following message box is displayed.

![Access Denied](How-to-overcome-Sample-Browser-Access-Denied-error_images/How-to-overcome-Sample-Browser-Access-Denied-error_img1.png)

To overcome this error, the Administrator should give access privileges to the folder path, for the non-admin user.
