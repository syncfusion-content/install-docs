12. Click Reload. 

    This message appears because the .exe.licenses file shown in the following screenshot has been modified to include the Syncfusion licensing information. To embed this information into the output EXE, you must rebuild the application. Verify whether this file has the Syncfusion version information you have the license to. If the file has information for any other version, every time you run the application, the Licensing Error message will appear.

## Resolving the licensing issues for the Syncfusion versions from 8.2.0.x to 13.1.0.x

When your project has been referred with Syncfusion version assemblies from v8.2 to 13.1, follow the given steps to resolve the licensing error.

1. Ensure that the Unlock Key for the respective version, has been installed properly in the registry using the License Manager utility from the Dashboard.

## Licensing information for the Syncfusion versions from v13.2.0.29 and later

Syncfusion has removed the Syncfusion.Core dependency for all the Essential Studio products from v13.2.0.29. So, it is not required to refer the Syncfusion.Core assembly in your project, when you are using Syncfusion v13.2.0.29 or later versions. If Syncfusion.Core assembly already added in your projects, then it should be removed.

Also, Syncfusion has removed run-time licensing for all Essential Studio products from the version 8.2.0.x. So, it is not required to embed the license.licx file in your project, if you are using v8.2 or later. Remove the license.licx file from your project, if it has been already added.
